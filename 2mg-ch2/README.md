## Assignment 2

We will do one more example from MG before switching to the first materials science example, just for practice.

Last week, as part of the setup, we did the Irises example.  Mostly it just got us going with getting our software 
stack set up, but also our first experience of a supervised learning ML problem.

First, let's analyze what happened with the Irises by thinking abou these questsions.
1. Create a text file that answers these questions, and make a PR into the `2sml` folder in `assignments`
  1. What (human, societal, scientific....) problem was being addressed by the iris model (1 or 2 sentences)
  2. What type of "mathematical" problem was it and what kind of ML model was needed (2 ish words e.g., "regression", "supervised learning")
  3. Which ML models were tried (name of the model) 
  4. What were the inputs (features) and what were the outputs (labels). (a list of them and a few sentences about what they meant)
  5. How well did the model solve the problem?
  6. How did the model work (briefly)?

## Muller-Guido linear regression examples

1. Look for an ipython notebook or python file named mg_linear_regression and follow the instructions 
1. For each example, at the top of the file in a text box or comment, answer these questions
  1. What (human, societal, scientific....) problem was being addressed by the iris model (1 or 2 sentences)
  2. What type of "mathematical" problem was it and what kind of ML model was needed (2 ish words e.g., "regression", "supervised learning")
  3. Which ML models were tried (name of the model) 
  4. What were the inputs (features) and what were the outputs (labels). (a list of them and a few sentences about what they meant)
  5. How well did the model solve the problem?
  6. How did the model work (briefly)?
7. Make a PR into the relevant assignment submission folder for the course
